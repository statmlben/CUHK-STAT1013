This course will give a conceptual introduction, implementation, and interpretation of the data scientist’s toolbox in practice. There are three components to this course. The first is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the project like Python, Github, Colab, Jupyter notebook, markdown, git. The second is a conceptual introduction to A/B test and statistical predictive methods. The third is about Case Studies of A/B Test and machine learning predictive methods based on the Toolbox.

**Course Goals:**

<!-- Upon completion of the course students should be able to:
- Implement and experiment with existing state-of-the-art methods for learning behavioral policies supervised by reinforcement, demonstrations and/or intrinsic curiosity.
- Evaluate the sample complexity, generalization and generality of these algorithms.
- Understand research papers in the field of robotic learning.
- Try out ideas/extensions on existing methods. -->

**Prerequisite Knowledge:**

<!-- Students should have a solid understanding of the following areas
- Algorithms: e.g., What problem does Dijkstra's algorithm solve?
- Probability: e.g., What is Bayes rule? How do you normalize a distribution?
- Computer vision: convolutional networks, object detection architectures, LSTMs, attention models
- Deep Learning: familiarity  with TensorFlow and/or Pytorch.
- Matrix Calculus: e.g., What are derivatives of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector products? What is the multivariate chain rule?
- Programming: e.g., What are classes and inheritance? How do you structure read data from files? How do you plot figures to visualize results?
- Numerical programming: e.g., How would you perform an elementwise product instead of an inner product? How do you invert a matrix? -->
